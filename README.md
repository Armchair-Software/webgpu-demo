# WebGPU Emscripten demo for the Armchair Engine

This is a simple proof of concept, a minimal 3D engine written in C++, compiled to WASM with Emscripten.  Running in the browser, rendering with WebGPU.

## Dependencies
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)
- CMake
- [VectorStorm](https://github.com/Armchair-Software/vectorstorm) (included)
- [LogStorm](https://github.com/VoxelStorm-Ltd/logstorm) (included)

## Building
The easiest way to assemble everything (including in-tree shader resource assembly) is to use the included build script:
```sh
./build.sh
```

To launch a local server and bring up a browser:
```sh
./run.sh
```

For manual builds with CMake, and to adjust how the example is run locally, inspect the `build.sh` and `run.sh` scripts.
